# LATA Hackathon, 2019
The project was similar to something like Google Maps for public transport. The idea was to show the best route from point A to point B by showing different types of ways the user could reach his destination. For example, the user could choose a more comfortable option where the bus is less full, but the travel time might take longer than the faster but less enjoyable ride.

## What I learned
In this project I learned to use the previous technologies (OpenStreetMap with Leaflet) and combine it with new ones like React, GraphQL and Laravel.
One of the bigger things I learned is simpler is better when time is of the essence. Having to fix all kinds of issues with the tech stack while time is running out is going to be worse in the end than having something simple and presentable.
